- **_includes/gamification/**: Reusable gamification components
  - **badge-display.html**: Component to display earned and available badges
  - **level-progress.html**: Component to show user level and progress
  - **points-counter.html**: Component to display user points
  - **challenge-card.html**: Component to display challenge information
  - **quiz-interface.html**: Component for interactive quizzes

#### 3. Layout Layer
- **_layouts/challenge.html**: Layout for challenge pages
- **_layouts/quiz.html**: Layout for quiz pages

#### 4. Asset Layer

- Modify existing layouts to include gamification components

#### 3. Asset Integration
- Add JavaScript and CSS files to assets/ directory
- Ensure proper loading order in scripts.html and styles.html

#### 4. Content Integration
- Create new directories for challenges and quizzes
- Ensure multi-language support for all gamification content

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Data Structure**
   - Create badges.yml, levels.yml, and challenges.yml in _data/
   - Define badge requirements, level thresholds, and challenge criteria

2. **Create Components**
   - Develop reusable components in _includes/gamification/
   - Ensure components support multi-language content

3. **Develop Layouts**
