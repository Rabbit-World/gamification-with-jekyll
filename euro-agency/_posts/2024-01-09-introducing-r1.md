<h1>introducing r1, a pocket companion that moves AI from words to action</h1>

<br>

Today, Santa Monica-based AI startup rabbit inc. launched r1, a custom-built consumer AI device running on a revolutionary natural-language operating system. r1 was developed to take a leap towards an app-free online experience, by introducing an operating system that navigates all of your apps quickly and efficiently so you don’t have to. r1’s operating system, rabbit OS, is the first OS ever built on Large Action Model (LAM), which can infer and model human actions on computer interfaces by learning users’ intention and behavior when they use specific apps, and then mimic and perform them both reliably and quickly. rabbit’s unique new r1 device costs $199, with pre-sales open from today and shipments beginning in late March 2024.


“Today is the beginning of a new era in human-machine interaction,” said rabbit Founder and CEO Jesse Lyu. “We’ve come to a point where we have hundreds of apps on our smartphones with complicated UX designs that don’t talk to each other. As a result, end users are frustrated with their devices and are often getting lost. rabbit is now building towards an intuitive app-free experience with the power of AI. Large Language Models, like ChatGPT, showed the possibility of understanding natural language with AI; our Large Action Model takes it one step further: it doesn’t just generate text in response to human input - it generates actions on behalf of users to help us get things done.”

Large Action Model (LAM) - Taking
Human-Computer Interaction from Output to Action
Large Action Model (LAM) is the cornerstone of the new r1 device – and the foundation of the future of human-machine interaction. LAM is designed to make AI systems see and act on apps in the same way humans do. It learns by demonstration – observing a human using an interface and reliably replicating the process, even if the interface is changed. It works by first understanding complex human intentions, then spinning up on human-oriented interfaces across all mobile and desktop environments on a customized cloud platform, and finally interacting with apps within the platform to achieve certain objectives without the need for complex, custom integrations like Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). LAM fundamentally removes the need for users to download and use multiple apps on their devices, and instead proactively carries out the tasks on such apps for them.

rabbit OS - The First Operating System
Built on the Large Action Model
rabbit OS, and the underlying LAM, adds abundant value to users' online life with “rabbits” - personal AI agents that carry out various tasks. Most voice-based assistants in smart home and portable consumer devices only handle simple requests such as turning on lights or checking the weather. rabbit OS, on the other hand, can handle most of one's digital errands - from simple tasks like searching for up-to-date information to complex tasks such as thoroughly researching and booking options for upcoming travel, or filling a virtual grocery store cart and completing transactions at check-out.


At launch, rabbit OS will already be trained to work with the most popular apps. In the near future, it will also feature an experimental capability that allows users to train their own “rabbits” to perform specific tasks on niche apps and workflows.


Through a web portal called “rabbithole,” a cloud hub where users can relay access to their existing apps to rabbits, users can enable different features and functionalities for their r1 device. Similar to handing one's unlocked phone to a friend who will help order takeout, rabbit OS performs tasks for users with their permission, without preemptively storing their identity information or passwords. rabbit OS does not create any proxy accounts, or require users to purchase additional subscriptions for their existing services, which leads to increased safety, security, and efficiency.

r1 - A New Approach to Intuitive AI Hardware
Dedicated to being LAM's best vehicle, r1 is built as an intuitive companion device that saves users time. While phones have evolved into all-encompassing personal entertainment devices in recent years, r1 is positioned as a standalone hardware portal to cut through distractions and help users handle their everyday digital tasks smarter, more efficiently, and more delightfully.


In collaboration with the renowned design firm Teenage Engineering, one of the world's leading innovators of award-winning hardware like synthesizers and other audio devices, the industrial design of r1 takes nostalgic cues from beloved retro gadgets like the Tamagotchi. Sleek and easily pocketable, r1 is roughly the size of a stack of Post-it notes and weighs only 115 grams. Available in an eye-catching Luminous Orange colorway, r1 is as strikingly beautiful as it is intuitively functional. It comes with custom hardware features including a 2.88 inch touchscreen display, a push-to- talk button, a scroll wheel for navigating through helpful “cards” to interact with different activities assisted by LAM, and “rabbit eye,” an AI enhanced, motorized vision system that serves as a rotating camera. rabbit eye is capable of making video calls as well as executing some of the most advanced computer vision applications. These features empower users to trigger actions more quickly than on even the most powerful flagship smartphones.


Unlike most consumer smart devices that must be managed on a smartphone, r1 operates as a fully standalone handheld device, with both Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity options. Inside the casing it boasts a 2.3 GHz MediaTek Helio P35 processor, 4 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage, a USB-C port and an empty SIM card slot, which is factory unlocked for true versatility. The battery is designed to last for all-day usage. r1 is the first device brought to market by rabbit, and future iterations of the hardware will evolve over time, based on feedback from users.

Advanced Technology Centered Around Privacy,
Responsibility and Sustainability
rabbit's technology is built with privacy and security at its core. rabbit does not store any user credentials of any third-party services. All the authentication processes happen on the destination services' login systems, so users have full control and freedom to link and unlink services to rabbit OS. rabbit's data infrastructure is fully compliant with major industry standards, ensuring high levels of security and encryption. Users have the option to delete their stored data at any time they desire and will also be aware of and have control over which types of actions are being delegated to the rabbits.


r1's hardware is also designed in a responsible manner. r1 does not have an “always listening mode,” and the microphone of r1 will not record unless the user presses the push-to-talk (PTT) button. r1's rotating camera defaults to a position that physically blocks the lens unless the user explicitly requests it, and you can manually put the device face-down. rabbit's hardware advocates that intelligence in the hands of the end-user is achievable without heavy client-side computing power. By carefully and securely offloading the majority of computation to data centers, rabbit OS's unique architecture opens up opportunities for ample performance and cost optimizations, making cutting-edge interactive AI experiences affordable. The hardware device hosting rabbit OS, starting with r1, does not require expensive and bulky processors and consumes little power.


r1 will be available for pre-sales starting January 9 for $199 with no additional monthly subscription required. Pre-sales for r1 start today on rabbit's official website, rabbit.tech. U.S. orders start shipping late March. Global orders start shipping later this year.

About rabbit
rabbit inc. is an AI startup developing a personalized operating system (OS) through a natural language interface and dedicated, affordable consumer hardware to host the OS. The OS, called rabbit OS, is capable of understanding complex user intentions, operating user interfaces, and performing actions on behalf of the user. The key technology powering rabbit OS is the Large Action Model (LAM), which understands human intentions on computers.


The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, and was founded by a group of researchers, engineers, and repeat entrepreneurs with extensive experience in shipping AI hardware products and operating high- performance computing (HPC) clusters to train large AI models. A two-time Y Combinator alumnus, rabbit's Founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, previously founded Raven Tech, a startup that pioneered conversational AI operating systems and was acquired by Baidu. rabbit raised $30m in funding to date from investors, including Khosla Ventures, Synergis Capital, and KAKAO Investment.
